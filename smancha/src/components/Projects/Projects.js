							title='A Portrait of the Spanish of Ector County'
							text='Inspired by the century-long line of scholarship on the Spanish(es) of New Mexico, I took it upon myself to examine the Spanish spoken in my home community in Ector County, TX. This dialectological survey takes a holistic approach, documenting the phonology, lexicon, and morphosyntax of Spanish speakers in Ector County. Iâ€™ve also published a short opinion piece (Mancha 2021, Mellon Mays Undergraduate Journal) on the future of the study of Spanish in Texas, looking to further a sociohistorical approach that acknowledges the history of Tejano communities in the state.'
